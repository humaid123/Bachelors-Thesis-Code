In this report, we consider the concept of `defect control'. We discuss its importance and the efficiency issues associated with ODE solvers based on Runge-Kutta methods \cite{MR3822086} that control the maximum defect of a continuous approximate solution. Standard approaches typically makes use of continuous Runge-Kutta methods \cite{MR3822086} to perform defect control which typically involves performing several evaluations of the right hand side function of the ODE, $f(t, y(t))$. In this chapter, we consider an approach to perform defect control using a multistep Hermite interpolant \cite{MR3822086} that requires no additional function evaluations. We will augment $4^{th}$, $6^{th}$ and $8^{th}$ order Runge Kutta methods with a Hermite cubic, with a sixth order Hermite-Birkhoff interpolant and an eighth order Hermite-Birkhoff interpolant and show that high quality interpolants can be obtained using no extra function evaluations. In its simplest form, a numerical method typically solves an ODE by stepping from the initial time to the final time, using stepsize $h$. It computes a solution approximation at the end of each step. A method is said to be of order $p$, if the error associated with the solution approximations it computes behaves like O($h^p$). We will discuss challenges associated with this approach and how these challenges can be addressed. We then conclude with suggestions for additional work that can be done on this project.
