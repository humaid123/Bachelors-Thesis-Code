===============
Future Work
We can potentially make the root-finding / DASKR look for a root at a static tolerance, say 1e-12 and see what happens. This will help us confirm the above hypothesis/this can potentially be placed in 'future' works...
===============

Use error-control on the first step... CRK on the first step.

Can derive optimal h.

Barycentric interpolation

general linear methods

10th order method

start with variable alpha. If alpha is too big. switch to static alpha.
